--problem--
-----------
There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,â€¦.,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls,
 such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

--example--
-----------
Examples:

Input: No of stalls = 5 
       Array: {1,2,8,4,9}
       And number of cows: 3

Output: One integer, the largest minimum distance 3
